# RS-Lang from the Dream Team

The following list of frameworks and libraries is used for this service:

1. **Vue.js** is the Progressive JavaScript Framework 
2. **Vue Router** is the official router for Vue.js
3. **Vuex** is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications
4. **Vuetify** is a Vue UI Library with beautifully handcrafted Material Components
5. **Vue-Loader** is a webpack loader that allows you to use Vue components in a format called single-file components
6. **Axios** - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js

Also core-js, eslint, babel, sass, various plugins, loaders, etc.

*Since the Vue community is very large, it is not difficult to find the necessary functionality that will be easily integrated. The ecosystem provides us with out-of-the-box routing and state management, which allows us to make a complex and reactive Single Page Application.*
